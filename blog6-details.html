                  <h3>Key Steps to Take When Your Thesis Is Due Soon</h3>
                  <h4>Step 1: Prioritize Your Tasks</h4>
                  <p>Identify the most critical tasks that need to be completed first. Focus on the sections of your thesis that require the most work and allocate your time accordingly.</p>
                  <h4>Step 2: Break Down the Work</h4>
                  <p>Break your thesis down into manageable sections. Tackle each section one at a time, setting small, achievable goals to maintain momentum and avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>

                  <h4>Step 5: Take Short Breaks</h4>
                  <p>While it’s important to stay focused, don’t forget to take short breaks to refresh your mind. A brief walk, some deep breathing, or a quick snack can help you recharge and maintain productivity.</p>
